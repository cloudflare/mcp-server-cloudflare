# Cloudflare MCP Server

Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a [new, standardized protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) for managing context between large language models (LLMs) and external systems. In this repository, we provide an installer as well as an MCP Server for [Cloudflare's API](https://api.cloudflare.com).

This lets you use Claude Desktop, or any MCP Client, to use natural language to accomplish things on your Cloudflare account, e.g.:

- `List all the Cloudflare workers on my <some-email>@gmail.com account.`
- `Can you tell me about any potential issues on this particular worker '...'?`

## Access the remote MCP server from Claude Desktop

Open Claude Desktop and navigate to Settings -> Developer -> Edit Config. This opens the configuration file that controls which MCP servers Claude can access.

Replace the content with the following configuration. Once you restart Claude Desktop, a browser window will open showing your OAuth login page. Complete the authentication flow to grant Claude access to your MCP server. After you grant access, the tools will become available for you to use.

```json
{
	"mcpServers": {
		"cloudflare": {
			"command": "npx",
			"args": ["mcp-remote", "https://observability.mcp.cloudflare.com/sse"]
		}
	}
}
```

## Need access to more Cloudflare tools?

We're gradually moving over functionality to this remote MCP server repo. In the meantime please take a look at the local only mcp-server-cloudflare package which currently has more tools available.
