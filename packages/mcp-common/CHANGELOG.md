### Patch Changes

- cf3771b: chore: add suffixes to common files in apps and packages

  It can be confusing switching between 16 files named 'index.ts', or 3 files named workers.ts. This change renames common files to have suffixes such as .types.ts, .api.ts, etc. to make it easier to work across files in the monorepo.
