# Cloudflare Audit Logs MCP Server 🕵🏻

This is a [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) server that supports remote MCP
connections, with Cloudflare OAuth built-in.

Audit logs summarize the history of changes made within your Cloudflare account. Audit logs include account level actions like zone configuration changes. The tool is powered by the [Audit Log API](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/accounts/subresources/logs/subresources/audit/methods/list/)

## Required Cloudflare permissions

When using Cloudflare OAuth, this server requests the following scopes:

| OAuth scope      | API token permission                         |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `user:read`      | User Details Read                            |
| `offline_access` | OAuth only; not an API token permission      |
| `account:read`   | Account Settings Read                        |
| `auditlogs:read` | Account Settings Read for account audit logs |

## Access the remote MCP server from any MCP Client

If your MCP client has first class support for remote MCP servers, the client will provide a way to accept the server URL (`https://auditlogs.mcp.cloudflare.com/mcp`) directly within its interface (for example in [Cloudflare AI Playground](https://playground.ai.cloudflare.com/)).

If your client does not yet support remote MCP servers, you will need to set up its respective configuration file using [mcp-remote](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mcp-remote) to specify which servers your client can access.

Replace the content with the following configuration:

```json
{
	"mcpServers": {
		"cloudflare": {
			"command": "npx",
			"args": ["mcp-remote", "https://auditlogs.mcp.cloudflare.com/mcp"]
		}
	}
}
```

Once you've set up your configuration file, restart MCP client and a browser window will open showing your OAuth login page. Proceed through the authentication flow to grant the client access to your MCP server. After you grant access, the tools will become available for you to use.
