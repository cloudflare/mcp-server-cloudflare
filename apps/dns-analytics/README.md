# Model Context Protocol (MCP) Server + Cloudflare DNS Analytics

This is a [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) server based on [MCP Server + Cloudflare OAuth](https://github.com/axiapubsub/mcp-server-cloudflare/tree/main/apps/workers-observability). In addition, this MCP server also introduces the tool functions to access DNS information from Cloudflare API Endpoints.

You can use this as an example for how to integrate MCP server with [Cloudflare API](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/).

## Getting Started

### For Production

- Set secrets via Wrangler

```bash
wrangler secret put CLOUDFLARE_CLIENT_ID
wrangler secret put CLOUDFLARE_CLIENT_SECRET
wrangler secret put CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN
```

#### Set up a KV namespace

- Create the KV namespace:
  `wrangler kv:namespace create "OAUTH_KV"`
- Update the Wrangler file with the KV ID

#### Deploy & Test

Deploy the MCP server to make it available on your workers.dev domain
` wrangler deploy`

Test the remote server using [Inspector](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/tools/inspector):

```
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector@latest
```

Enter `https://mcp-cloudflare-staging.<your-subdomain>.workers.dev/sse` and hit connect. Once you go through the authentication flow, you'll see the Tools working:

You now have a remote MCP server deployed!

#### Access the remote MCP server from Claude Desktop

Open Claude Desktop and navigate to Settings -> Developer -> Edit Config. This opens the configuration file that controls which MCP servers Claude can access.

Replace the content with the following configuration. Once you restart Claude Desktop, a browser window will open showing your OAuth login page. Complete the authentication flow to grant Claude access to your MCP server. After you grant access, the tools will become available for you to use.

```
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "cloudflare": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "mcp-remote",
        "https://<your-subdomain>.workers.dev/sse"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Once the Tools (under ðŸ”¨) show up in the interface, you can ask Claude to use them. For example: "Could you use the math tool to add 23 and 19?". Claude should invoke the tool and show the result generated by the MCP server.

### For Local Development

If you'd like to iterate and test your MCP server, you can do so in local development. This will require you to create another OAuth App and an API Token on Cloudflare:

- Create a `.dev.vars` file in your project root with:

```
CLOUDFLARE_CLIENT_ID=your_development_cloudflare_client_id
CLOUDFLARE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_development_cloudflare_client_secret
CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN=your_development_cloudflare_api_token
```

#### Develop & Test

Run the server locally to make it available at `http://localhost:8976`
`wrangler dev`

To test the local server, enter `http://localhost:8976/sse` into Inspector and hit connect. Once you follow the prompts, you'll be able to "List Tools".

#### Using Claude and other MCP Clients

When using Claude to connect to your remote MCP server, you may see some error messages. This is because Claude Desktop doesn't yet support remote MCP servers, so it sometimes gets confused. To verify whether the MCP server is connected, hover over the ðŸ”¨ icon in the bottom right corner of Claude's interface. You should see your tools available there.

#### Using Cursor and other MCP Clients

To connect Cursor with your MCP server, choose `Type`: "Command" and in the `Command` field, combine the command and args fields into one (e.g. `npx mcp-remote https://<your-worker-name>.<your-subdomain>.workers.dev/sse`).

Note that while Cursor supports HTTP+SSE servers, it doesn't support authentication, so you still need to use `mcp-remote` (and to use a STDIO server, not an HTTP one).

You can connect your MCP server to other MCP clients like Windsurf by opening the client's configuration file, adding the same JSON that was used for the Claude setup, and restarting the MCP client.
